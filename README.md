**About Infect-ID**:

_The idea of Infect-ID sparked from the recent pandemic, that of course being COVID-19._

_We realized the importance of locating patient zero -- Officials could isolate and quarantine 
likely infected and predict a spread pattern. Also, in the future, it becomes important for 
epidemiologists to find the first known case because it helps work out how the outbreak occurred, 
and gives us an idea of how to prevent further outbreaks in the future._

_As high school students, we know our tool is not a perfect nor completely practical one._ 

_However, it is a prototype that can be developed further._

_This is a tool we've released in hopes it can be developed further. As such, we have released our 
project under an open-source license for others to continue editing and contributing to our vision._
